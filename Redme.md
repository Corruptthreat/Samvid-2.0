We are back with yet another season of SAMVID — the techno-cultural college fest of Shri Shankaracharya Technical Campus, Bhilai. A nationwide fest which is recognized as one of the most magnificent events ever happened in Chhattisgarh State, assimilating many technical, cultural and management events into one holistic event, attracting a mass of nearly 25,000 students from all major colleges of Chhattisgarh and other states in vicinity. Empowering latent talents and putting one’s caliber at test on a national platform, it encompasses the wide and diverse spectra of events which will aid the nourishment of one’s forte. We cordially invite you to celebrate this festival of knowledge, joy and progress with us.

SAMVID pertains to the divine consciousness. It holds true to its name & focuses on awakening our dormant consciousness of talents.
